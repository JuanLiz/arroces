mkdir -p $HOME/.themes/ && cp -r theme/. $HOME/
cp -r alacritty/. $HOME/

```

Once finished, rebuild font cache:

### To Do widget

In order to use the To Do widget, connection to Microsoft Graph needs to be configured.

1. Open [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_RegisteredApps/ApplicationsListBlade) and click `New registration`
2. Enter a name, choose account type `Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)`
3. Copy and keep the Application (client) ID under the app name for later use.
4. Under `Manage`, click Authentication.
5. Enable `Allow public client flows` and save.
6. Under `Manage`, click API Permissions and then, `Add a permission`
7. Click `Microsoft Graph > Delegated permissions`
8. Search "Tasks", then check `Tasks.ReadWrite` and `Tasks.ReadWrite.Shared`
9. Click `Add permissions`

At this point, application has been registered successfully.

Install To Do requirements:

```sh
pip install -r $HOME/.config/eww/dashboard/scripts/mstodo-eww/requirements.txt
```

### Setting environment variables

Create and open dotenv file:

```sh
nano $HOME/.config/eww/dashboard/scripts/.env
```

Paste the following text:

```plaintext
CLIENT_ID=your_id
EMAIL=your_email
PASSWORD=your_password
OWM_KEY=your_owm_key
OWM_CITY=your_city_id
```

Replace your_id with previously generated Application (client) ID.

For pending emails counter, you need to set your_email and your_password (generate app password if you use 2FA/MFA).

For weather, you need to set [OpenWeatherMap API key](https://openweathermap.org/api) (OWM_KEY) and [city id](http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.json.gz) (OWM_CITY)

After this, save and close.

> At this point, **widgets are ready and now you can execute eww**
